# Webpage
This work-in-progress webpage will feature a variety of my content, including the vast majority of my Javascript programs, small executabke binaries, images and videos for games. Will also feature code tutorials and game reviews, so stick around as the website gets better and better with time!
All files in this webpage including this readme, are still under construction.

This is intended to be my main public project, additionally my shadertoy. Most games in C are binary only releases.
